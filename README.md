Basic Discord Bot
=================
This is a basic discord bot, written in Python using the Discord.py module. Its original intent was to make a Discord bot that you can run in a Docker container, but you can also run the script by itself.

It is currently not very customizable, but I am planning on making it more useful in the future.
